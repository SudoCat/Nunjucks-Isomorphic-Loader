# Nunjucks Isomorphic loader for webpack

This is a fairly simple nunjucks loader for webpack. Unlike the others I found,
this one supports the HtmlWebpackPlugin, making it easy for you to create your
templates and include all of your entry files.

For handling web compilation, the plugin will fallback to nunjucks-loader. 

Sorry for the lacklustre documentation. Still very much WIP.
